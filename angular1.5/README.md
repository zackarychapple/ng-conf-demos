# Angular 1 Component Router Demo

This application showcases the new component router that is available
for Angular 1.5

## Running the App

**HEADS UP**
*The current version of the router on npm does not work with this demo.
You need to use the file that is currently in this repository under the
`/node_modules/@angular/router/angular1/angular_1_router.js` path.
So be careful when you run the install that it doesn't overwrite this file.*

**Install the dependencies**
Simply install the necessary node dependencies and run a local server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

A browser tab should open showing the application running at http://localhost:3000/
